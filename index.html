               <h1>Welcome to my little blog for people who want to visit some Europeans capitals one day. Indeed, I will
                  give you my
                  personal opinion on the capitals that I have already visited during a small tour of Europe I went on in
                  2015 with my
                  friends. In addition I will tell you how I experienced my tour of Europe.</h1>

         <a href="berlin"></a>
         <h2>Berlin, GERMANY</h2>
         <img class="berlin" src="berlin.jpg" alt="" width="700">
         <p><strong>Berlin</strong> is one of the most beautiful cities in the world that I have
            visited. When I talk about
            beauty, I am not talking about skyscrapers like in New York, but something deeper - like the number of artists who
            are
            concentrated there and the simplicity of the people. Indeed, Berlin brings together everything that a tourist looks
            for. It's
            an artistic city, the people are very nice, and - for those who like to party - you'll find what they're looking
            for too. In
            addition, you will have no difficulty in communicating because Berliners are most often bilingual.</p>
         <a href="praha"></a>
         <h2>Praha, Czech Republic</h2>
         <img class="praha" src="praha.jpg" alt="" width="700">
         <p><strong>Prague </strong>Prague has the advantage of being a small city with an extraordinary concentration of
            beautiful monuments and museums.
            In one day you could visit new Prague and old Prague. Then try tasting goulash in Prague, I'm not
            telling you that
            you'll like it, but it's good to discover new foods.</p>

         <a href="Vienna"></a>
         <h2>Vienna, AUSTRIA</h2>
         <img class="Vienna" src="Vienna.jpg" alt="" width="700">
         <p> <strong>Vienna</strong> Vienna has a lot of similarities with Berlin; it's a very artistic city with a lot
            of museums. It is a good city to
            visit with a family because it is quieter compared to Berlin.</p>
         <a href="budapest"></a>
         <h2>Budapest, HUNGRY</h2>
         <img class="budapest" src="budapest.jpg" alt="" width="700">
         <section class="section1">
            <p id="testP"><strong>Budapest </strong>here is a city that I found very hilarious. Here are some anecdotes: I went to a coffee bar where water was more
            expensive than beer. Also, every morning the receptionist at our hostel made me drink a drink that made me dizzy; apparently
            it was the custom. Beyond that, in Budapest you can go to the public sauna outside, and for festival lovers you could go
            to the Sziget which is one of the biggest festivales in Europe.</p>
         </section>
         <a href="ljubljana"></a>
         <h2>Lubjana, Slovenia</h2>
         <img class="ljubljana" src="ljubljana.jpg" alt="" width="700">
         <p><strong>Lubjana</strong> is a very charming city which strongly resembles a village in the sense that there is
            hardly anyone in the city. Indeed, the
            density per inhabitant seems to be low and there is a lot of greenery in the city. For people who want to
            visit a
            European capital and feel like they are in the countryside, Lubjana is the destination for you.</p>
         <a href="zagreb"></a>
         <h2>Zagreb, CROATIA</h2>
         <img src="zagreb.jpg" alt="" width="700">

         <p><strong>Zagreb :</strong> Zagreb closely resembles Prague. Indeed in just one day we were able to visit
            the city. I would advise you to go
            to the south of Croatia, because there are charming little villages by the sea.</p>
